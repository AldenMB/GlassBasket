# GlassBasket

![picture of the completed basket](basket.jpg)

The purpose of this project was to use some oddly-shaped scraps of glass. I had narrow strips left over from fitting a window, which I cut into trapezoids. The corners are 3D printed, designed using CadQuery.

If you decide to make this yourself, the only thing you need to change in software is the thickness of the glass, and perhaps the angle (if you desire a different angle). The template SVG can be printed with Inkscape. The essential thing is to cut the glass with the correct angles -- the dimensions are not too important, so long as they match between the various pieces. And do make sure to dull the edges of the glass. I used some fine grit sand paper.

The structure holds together without glue, since the typical forces exerted are not in the directions which permit separation. If you wish to glue it anyhow, a bit of superglue would do the trick.
